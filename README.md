# Skins

## TiEmu
Skins for the Ti-v200 and TiEmu (https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/387/38770.html)

## VTI
For this skin to work with VTI, you’ll first need to convert it with SkinEdit from here: https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/232/23201.html


## Big and Bright
Big (1560x1500) and bright skin for TiEnum.
I made this skin from scratch and optimized it for my purpose. I don’t like to use the mouse much.
Also I relabeled the diamond (to CTRL) and 2nd (to ALT) keys. CLEAR became DEL. So this is more keyboard-friendly. There are now only two ENTER keys left - I still think this is one too many. Also removed one of the 2nd (ALT) keys.
