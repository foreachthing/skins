# Skins

## TiEmu
Skins for the Ti-v200 and TiEmu (https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/387/38770.html)

## VTI
For this skin to work with VTI, you’ll first need to convert it with SkinEdit from here: https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/232/23201.html

## Big and Bright
Big (1560x1500) and bright skin for TiEnum.
I made this skin from scratch and optimized it for my purpose. I don’t like to use the mouse much.
Also I relabeled the diamond (to CTRL) and 2nd (to ALT) keys. CLEAR became DEL. So this is more keyboard-friendly. There are now only two ENTER keys left - I still think this is one too many. Also removed one of the 2nd (ALT) keys.

### New in this branch:
* Reversed all CTRL (diamond) and ALT (2nd) key labels to be easier to type. All CTRL (diamond) labels are now on the left of the key and all ALT (2nd) labels are on the right.
